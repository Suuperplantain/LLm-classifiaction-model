# LLM Classification Fine-Tuning

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) for a text-classification task using a dataset from Kaggle.  
The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generating predictions for submission.

##  Dataset
The Kaggle dataset includes:
- `train.csv` – labelled training data  
- `test.csv` – test data without labels  
- `sample_submission.csv` – required submission format  

##  What the Notebook Does
- Loads and inspects the dataset  
- Cleans and prepares text for modelling  
- Fine-tunes a classification model on the training data  
- Evaluates prediction performance  
- Generates outputs suitable for Kaggle submission  

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Transformers / LLM fine-tuning frameworks  
- Kaggle Notebook environment  

##  How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Kaggle or locally.  
2. Upload or link the dataset.  
3. Run all cells to train the model and produce predictions.  
4. Export the output file for Kaggle submission.

##  Purpose
This project serves as a practical example of:
- Applying NLP techniques  
- Fine-tuning a modern LLM  
- Building a complete classification pipeline  

Feel free to clone, modify, or extend the model for your own datasets.
